<MainText pb={4}><b>THE (FORMERLY) RADIANT CHARACTER</b> </MainText>
    <MainText pb={6}>
        <DropCap>I</DropCap> wander across a plaza exuding luminescence. I was assigned this designation in a Muriel Spark novelette, long crumpled and pulped sometime in her sleepy ‘70s phase. So here I am strolling along this plaza, exuding an intangible form of radiance, both literal (radioactive skin as a permanent light source), and characteristic (a peptastic persona where merriness oozes from my every pore), respecting both radiant interpretations, blinding other characters with my wattage while bombarding them with upbeat pith in imitation of Dame Muriel. “WHAT A LUVVERLY DAY!” I say to them as they run to safety, shielding their peepers from my floodlight lumens. The impossibility of making friends in person or online (my radiance made focusing on a laptop screen impossible) meant I set up in business as a rent-a-lamp, providing free illumination for sporting events and the stage, taking what pleasure I could in the brief orders I received from lighting directors to stand in a certain position and move to the left an inch and so on. Ultimately, my excessively luminous personality was not able to cope with this fun-free servitude, so I had no choice except to puncture my skin until the lumens dimmed. My body, at the end of this pain-packed self-mutilation session, was a siege of scars with flickers of light coming from the unbowed pores like a series of pocket torches with batteries expiring. The havoc wreaked on my figure smashed my self-confidence, my remaining in any way radiant an impossibility, leaving me no choice except to pass from my assignation the way a Volkswagen Golf moves along a B-road at four in the afternoon unobserved by precisely no one.

    <MainText pb={4}><b>THE CHARACTER WHO MISSES ANNIKA STRÖMBERG</b></MainText>

<MainText pb={6}>
 <DropCap>Y</DropCap>ou come to a state when all is not as circular as things seem. Your radii are less certain. Your circumferii are somewhat loose in the round. You arrive in that place of solid funk. I arrived inside this wonked radii on March the oh-fourth when Madeleine went on tour with reformed Swedish pop act Ace of Base. She had been threatening to walk out on me for months for an intensive tour of upper Sweden. In the 2010s, songwriters Jonas and Ulf had removed the original two female singers (both having committed the cardinal of no longer being twenty and sexy). We had arrived at that stage in our relationship when the louche fortnight of rum, tacos, and fairy lights in a bedroom is no longer viable as a long-term emotional binding, so she went on tour with Ace of Base. Our kissing started in 2008, when our lips touched following seven hours at the Punctuation Conference. I had pioneered a new punctuation mark and she had applauded with arms aflame. Our kissing lasted seven minutes, a sumo session of lip-on-lip, our two wet lips coming together with the hot intensity of cheese melting on toast. I had eaten melted cheese an hour before, so the literal taste of melted cheese came into our mutual lips atop the figurative one, creating a one cheesegasm of a snog. I kissed her on the pavement. Our mutual selves floated upwards in a seven-minute swoon of lip-focused lust, our bodies rooted to the concrete, our loins somewhere overhead in a flock of cormorants. At the eighth minute, in a moment of insane improv, she slipped a tongue between the burning hotness of my lips, introducing her long unfurling seeker around the mucal interzone of my inner mouth, braising the molars at moments. I have to confess, the intake of a kiss is something comparable to the hot upshoot of an idea into one’s mental PowerPoint. Later, I lost her to Ulf. Now, I wander around parks recalling our days looking at frenziedly feeding fowl. I miss seeing a swan in the distance, sailing with a litter of grey-furred cygnets in tow, and the anticipation at moving nearer to the swan, the knowledge that looking upon a swan for as long as the swan will tolerate you is coming, and then arriving at the swan, and staring as the swan as her ludicrously svelte neck-cum-head arches with painful certitude towards the water to lap at algae, and the incredulity that these graceful, but utterly fucking sluggish and useless birds, have somehow survived thousands of years without extinction from ravenous swooping vultures. I miss swans. I miss my lover’s kisses. I also miss our eating. I miss shoving a fork in a huge plate of mashed potato. Really forking up the mash. Skinning the creamy head from that buttery mound, compacting the mash into separate forts, one side the Sunis, one the Catholics, and staging a cross-theological fracas with the beans, or flooding the mash in a monsoon of gravy, or impressing ridges into the creamy ramparts with the upside of a fork. I miss mash. I miss my lover’s kisses.

<b>THE CHARACTER RECALLING THE TIME HE LOST SOMETHING IN THE POCKET OF A MAUVE CAGOULE</b> 
</MainText>

<MainText pb={0}>
I was walking along the pavement when I recalled the time I lost something from the pocket of a mauve cagoule. I recalled the time when something fell from the left or right pocket of the cagoule and landed on the pavement with either a thud or a thump. I recalled that moment with astonishing clarity—the near-sensual kinesis between my hand and the item, the scent of whelks and vaseline in the air, the hum of local choral singers—and I smiled at the recall of that lovely kinesis, although I could not remember what the item was, and wondered if the item might have been something of import, like a bank card or a photograph of a loved one, perhaps a mother or a gerbil. The prospect of such light and unweighty items thudding or thumping on a pavement was improbable, so I concluded that this item must have been something more substantial, such as a crystal ball or a hardback novel. The prospect of a crystal ball or a hardback novel fitting into a left or right pocket of a cagoule was improbable. The thought that an item of sufficient weightiness might fit into a small pocket was unlikely, and then I recalled how a paperweight might fit inside a pocket, and that a paperweight, if it landed on the underside, might make a thudding or a thumping sound (although a paperweight was more inclined to land glass-side up, and smash). I had never had occasion to use a paperweight across the short lifespan that Yahweh has allotted me, so I considered other possibilities. I considered a tub of something, such as a tub of eczema cream, then I recalled that I am not a sufferer of that particular skin condition, and so parked that notion. I recalled that I am however a sufferer of psoriasis, and so I might have been walking around with a tub of psoriasis cream, and that it was possible that I had placed a tub of that particular cream into the pocket of this cagoule, and that the tub had emerged from the pocket with a thud or a thump. I took my penis in hand as I recalled this incident.
