        <DropCap>I</DropCap> was whelped, without a wisp of conference, in a poor wet nation named Scotland. In this poor wet nation we have four main means of rustling up rupees to fatten Lady Earth’s coffers. The first is letting small rooms and cupboards from which assorted Londoners and Americans can stare awestricken at lochs. The second is selling unpleasant malt beverages for people to sup while staring awestricken at lochs. The third is letting undersize plastic chairs from which persons can squint toward millionaires booting a leather bag around fake grass for an hour over the promised running time. The fourth is the rendering into prose of sex crimes, stabbings, shootings, and smotherings in perpetually Novemberish cities: the crime novel.

    There are around 30+ successful Scottish crime novelists, and 3500+ unsuccessful or unpublished ones. These writers, tirelessly prolific, seemingly unstoppable, clack their creations into being at the rate or two or three novels per annum. Their protagonists are cop ciphers who solve evil stuff—an endless smörg of asphyixations, buggerings, chokings, maimings, throat-slashings, and the occasional Fiat Uno theft. These writers bring income to publishers, because these writers have readers. And in creative writing classes spanning the Mull of Galloway to Oosta, sit clumps of aspiring crime writers with their procedurals set in local towns and conurbs, featuring more beleaguered malt-tanking puzzle-solving philandering perma-divorced sneer-lipped hard-talking DIs and DCs than the land’s actual police stations (where the staff spend 70% of their time in conference rooms with crime novelists). And the unofficial king among these lovers of murder and sex crimes is the fecund imp Ian James Rankin OBE.

<b>Reader</b>: All right. Stop there, Bubba. “Lovers of sex crimes”? 
</Box>

<Box>
<b>Me</b>: Quote me correctly. 
</Box>

<Box>
<b>Reader</b>: Fine, “lovers of [ ... ] sex crimes”. 
</Box>

<Box>
<b>Me</b>: Better. 
</Box>

<Box>
<b>Reader</b>: Nicholls, your middle name is “sad parsnip”. These writers are smart for having identified the audience’s lust for rapes, stabbings, slashings, and other shrieks of vicarious misanthropy, and finding a form for exacting their own revenge fantasies. And one, I must add, that yields monthly yen, that drums up monthly deutschmarks, that poops out monthly pfennigs, that zaps monthly zlotys, that . . . 
</Box>

<Box>
<b>Me</b>: Enough. 
</Box>

<Box>
<b>Reader</b>: These writers have tapped into what Zola called “the beast in man”, i.e. our lust for seeing someone’s skull crushed like a pomegranate under a steamroller, our lust for seeing someone richer, sexier, funnier, eviller, nicer, or literally anyone who isn’t us, have their brains rearranged into  Rorschachs across the wainscoting. If you could make thousands of monthly kwacha exploiting these truths, you would. 
</Box>

<Box>
<b>Me</b>: Let me address this piffle. Yes, a clever means of misanthropic succour. But these embittered writers have let their insane loathing for humankind bleed into the publishing world with their unapologetic milking of the brand. For every fifteenth installment in the DCI Robulus series, a more imaginative and competent novel from an unknown writer is mouldering on a to-read pile, while the publisher proofreads another scene of a barman having his right knee knived in a Possil pub. These crime hacks have monopolised the Scottish publishing machine, smothering the realm of infinite invention (“literature”) under reams of uninspired workmanlike prose. And those writers currently at the teat on MA programmes at fine Scottish universities will have nowhere to publish their alt-kook and nü-weird works, have no one to whisper the words “promising” or “up-and-coming” into their ears . . . what will the next crop of novelists resemble? The macerated corpse on p.272 that constitutes “the twist”. Reader, no need to be upset. All I am saying is that these crime novelists have perpetuated the biggest and most heinous crime of all: strangling the future of Scottish literature.

I have envied Ian Rankin since the first sleepy poke of awareness of his existence morphed into a multi-limbed grope of awareness of his existence and stature and fame and first name: Ian. His kindly face insinuated itself into my consciousness like that recurring nightmare where a plump man in a mink coat pursues my naked six-year-old body through seventeen corridors while humming ‘Leaning on the Everlasting Arms’. The novels of Ian Rankin partypooped their way into my perception in my late teens, first seen in their scores in second-hand bookshops, where the Inspector Rebus series provides a form of additional cavity wall insulation and an ersatz caulking to absorb enroaching damp. His novels are, quite literally, keeping Scottish second-hand bookshops from crumbling. 
</MainText>

<MainText pt={4} pb={4}>
I was raised, like Rankin, in an inconsequential village in the lower half of Scotland’s low-hanging breeks, in a working-class prefab where “possibility” was a word that had long been riddled with bullets and buried in a landfill. Like Rankin, I attended Edinburgh University, where I studied literature. Like Rankin, I have a repulsive haircut and a beauty spot on my right cheek (his is, of course, larger). Like Rankin, I was a punk musician in a band named The Dancing Pigs (left-handed slap-bass, occasional bongo duties). And like Rankin, I was a striving and ambitious writer, whose first few books were literary novels (although mine are better). Then our paths and personalities diverged. 
</MainText>

<MainText>
Rankin is a sociable, loveable, street-smart renaissance man rammed too far up the hindgut of Scottish culture to ignore. I am a hermit-like, unloveable, woodland-dwelling one-trick wonder who never participates in Scottish culture apart from attending the Glasgow Film Theatre to watch Russian miserablism. Rankin is a man who wears his Scottishness with ease, penning essays on whisky and not living in London. I wear my Scottishness like a damp undershirt two sizes two small, penning tomes where Scotland is blown to smithers in a merciless nuclear attack from Luxembourg. Rankin likes hip new indie bands and reads comics. I like early-80s Shonen Knife and  the novels of Rodrigo Fresán. Rankin is an OBE and FRSE. I will never receive these honours, as I will never be populist enough. Rankin has no complex about writing popular genre fiction for a broad audience while maintaining a sideline in cool countercultural activities that endear him to most unembittered people. I resent writers who write for an audience and spend most of my time indulging my niche interests that no one particularly likes and pretending not to care. Rankin had an extramarital affair, cultivating a “bad boy” persona. I have no capacity for romantic betrayal and I find myself riddled with shame for masturbating to another woman’s breasts. Rankin is a millionaire with a large Edinburgh mansion and eats lobster bisque. I have no money and live in a third-floor flat and eat Wotsits. 
</MainText>

<MainText pt={4} pb={4}>
Rankin is everything I could have been, if I had veered another way, if I had hoed another road, if I had been born Ian Rankin. As a consequence, I observe him in motion across the Scottish literary orrery, moving like an fast-flaming meteorite towards the darkened moon of my pointless ambition. He is my destroyer. He is my nemesis. He is the living physical embodiment of everything I loathe about Scotland and Scottish literature.

    <b>Reader</b>: Troll! Troll!

    <b>Me</b>: Not so. I made myself chuckle.
</Box>

<Box><b>Reader</b>: Have you read any of the Rebus novels? </Box>

<Box><b>Me</b>: Now that is chucklesome. </Box>

<Box><b>Reader</b>: Then your essay is meaningless. </Box>

<Box><b>Me</b>: I am not interested in meaning. Please read the introduction again.</Box> 

<Box><b>Reader</b>: You can’t— </Box>

<Box><b>Me</b>: OK, I had a “look inside” at one on Amazon. It has this sentence: “She seemed to have given up the steak and was dabbing her mouth with her napkin.” </Box>

<Box><b>Reader</b>: And? </Box>

<Box><b>Me</b>: If that is literature, Allan Massie, I might as well pack in the whole thing. And the other sentences ain’t shining timeless beacons neither. </Box>

<Box><b>Reader</b>: Who’s Allan Massie? </Box>

<Box><b>Me</b>: He’s coming up. </Box>

<Box><b>Reader</b>: Look, Bubbo, have you made a comprehensive study of Scottish crime fiction for this piece? That is all we care about. We are sitting here thinking “if he hasn’t researched this, his opinions are meaningless, this essay is a waste of my time, and this essay, critically, has no aesthetic or academic value, and what we expect from our modern essayists is a basic level of immersiveness, so we can praise their hard-won words that spill from their fact-packed brains to the page to our empty, factless brains.” That is what we think. We won’t accept a single word of this vacuous critique unless you have immersed yourself in the works of thirty-six crime novelists, and read the entire works of  Rankin twice. </Box>

<Box><b>Me</b>: In this “essay”, I have scrunched the concept of “reasoned analysis” into a spiteful ball and hurled that ball towards a flaming bin, much like I do when I read another four-star Rankin review in a broadsheet. I tear the page from that paper, observing phrases like “much-loved detective” and “atmosphere as rich as the plot”, and lunge them towards the unopened window in a fuming whirl of frothing hatred, only to have the pages bounce back towards my crying face, and brush my lips, as if the author is trying to seduce me through the stabby crunch of his scrunched-up broadsheet review. This “essay” is an intense probing of and unconcise lancing of a yam-yellow literary boil. That yam-yellow boil is named Ian Rankin. </Box>

<Box><b>Reader</b>: More provocation. </Box>

<Box><b>Me</b>: Tee hee!</Box>

Rankin-Rebus’s Edinburgh is an imagined place, one where the middle-class Morningside-dweller can imagine a sordid and sexy underworld inside in their squirearchical, punchably pretty city, and romanticise about the pea-souper mystique of RL Stevenson, the blueprint for this (and most other) fictitious versions of the capital. The raggedy outskirts aside, pitching a dark detective series in Edinburgh is akin to situating a hotbed of sleazy criminality on the streets of Kensington or Chelsea. The real sordid underworld of criminal ooze exists in the podunk towns and villages, in the un-picture-postcard perfect places. Rankin’s twinning of scenic Edinburgh with stabbed dudes and evil shenanigans allows the reader a cozy backdrop from which to indulge in their violent rubbernecking while the real crimes take place in unpleasant, socially bereft backwaters that readers would rather not visit textually, or actually, among desperate and impoverished people. The brooding darkness that Rankin strains to cultivate in books with fistable titles like <i>The Naming of the Dead</i> or <i>The Impossible Dead</i> or <i>Dead Souls</i> (pinching from Gogol is a hangable offence, with apologies to Ian Curtis) is in fact couched in a romantic fantasy of Victorian Scotland (a fantasy the Scottish literary world has been milking for touristic not artistic purposes for a long time).
</MainText>

<MainText>
Rankin’s novels have become an unwitting wing of the Auld Reekie tourist industry, and in his undeniable role as a corporate, establishment, cash-hoovering man, Rankin has long lost the kind of outsider rock-and-roll cred that he desperately strives to maintain, playing in third-rate dad-rock bands with broadsheet journalists to prove to his audience he is still that plucky young punk from Cardenden underneath. The Rebus novels are nothing more than fat tourist pamphlets, crammed into bookshops and libraries, and no matter how many Rolling Stones album titles he pinches, no matter how much indie cred he tries to claw back, the fact remains that tours around Rebus’s Edinburgh can be purchased, proving the man is in shameless cahoots with The Man. Rankin is the establishment figure young Scottish writers should be kicking against with violent, knifey jackboots.

<b>Reader:</b> Yeeees. I suppose we must plunge into the old discussion about populist art propping up outsider art. No Rankin, no unknown innovative new novelists. Bestsellers enabling poor-selling yet interesting new fiction. 
</Box>

<Box>
<b>Me:</b> We could. Except there is no innovative new work. There’s Rankin. There’s Rebus after Rebus after Fox after Fox. There’s DI Tinwhistle, DI Pocklochie, DI Carsehole, DI McStabber, DI Switchblood, DI Hamfisted, DI Buggeringshitweasel. There’s crime publishers and crime publishers and crime publishers. There’s Hackface Books. Strangle the Kitten Publishing. Babydrowner Inc. Bang Bang Stab Stab Press. There are no other publishers. There’s one insane, unstoppable exploitation of a population’s seething bloodlust, a nation lusting for war and conflict who flock to libraries to read about the immoralities they are desperate to commit themselves. There is a population barely holding the veneer of their lives together, as they sit and stream cop show after cop show after cop show after cop show, then stuff their brains with cop novel after cop novel, in the hope that some of that sexy evil makes their monotonous peacetime lives passable, until the time comes they can pick up a bayonet and ram it into someone else’s guts, like their whole being is screaming out to do. Yes, crime writers, you think you are exploring the frightening labyrinths of human psychology, you think you are plumbing <i>la bête humaine</i>, when you are really showing your own murderous cravings, and stirring up a nation’s lust to maim and stab. You are architects of evil and your souls wallow in an amoral sewer (except on Twitter, where you speak out against moral injustice, in order not to alienate your audience).

Allan Massie’s assertion in a fawning <i>Telegraph</i> article in 2015 that “crime fiction is real literature” seems like the sort of thing someone who writes crime fiction would write if that person considered themselves above crime fiction and was irked when reviewers failed to praise their crime fiction written for cash in the same manner as their literary novels. (Or a better version of that sentence). Rankin was created in collaboration with Aberdonian novelist and critic Massie in the late 1980s, when the latter said to the former: “Do you think John Buchan ever worried about whether he was writing literature or not?”, and has remained one of Rankin’s most prominent cheerleaders. In his article slapping down genre-baiters, Massie dismisses the inferiority of crime as “palpable nonsense”, then cites Walter Scott, Dickens, Dostoevsky, and Gide as examples of crime-as-literature (though these are writers of literature-with-crime, not the current churners of product, and in what respects the mediocre 18th Rebus novel <i>Standing in Another Man’s Grave</i> compares with <i>Crime & Punishment</i> in the literature stakes is a question too perplexing for this feeble snobbish brain to compute). You can’t merely mention authors who wrote about crimes in their works and then place Ian Rankin and other crime writers in their ranks because they write about crimes too . . . this is madness, this is a criminal rationale, this is to conveniently bypass every brilliant sentence written by Dostoevsky <i>et al</i> in contrast with the hacky third-rate ones written by Rankin <i>et al</i>. Madness! 
</MainText>

<MainText pt={4} pb={4}>
Massie then states that crime fiction has the edge over literary stuff, because “he [sic] can range over [sic] all levels of society, for crime breaches the barriers of class”. Massie’s summation is that modern literary novels “tend to deal with one layer of society”, “with people all leading the same sort of life”. This assertion pleads ignorance of the rich seam of literature featuring characters from all sorts of backgrounds, some from varying layers of society in the same novel, i.e. it seems to ignore literature. The article then makes the usual “duality of the city” reference (RL Stevenson) switches into a promo for the Rebus novels, throws in a Latin phrase (translated, of course, since the writer is not a snob, although it is snobbish to assume that we wouldn’t understand the Latin phrase ourselves and need the trans). Essentially, the case for Rankin as literary literature is not made, because there isn’t one. 
</MainText>

<MainText>
The case that crime fiction is literature is an open one. However, crime writers have to start writing it. Rankin has to start writing crime fiction as literature. You can’t write sentences like “She seemed to have given up the steak and was dabbing her mouth with her napkin” and expect to be bumping uglies with A.S. Byatt and Henry Miller. If these writers stopped worrying about readers, audiences, publishers, demographics, formulas, balance sheets, critics, then their heads would be clear to write literature. 
</MainText>

<MainText pt={4} pb={4}>

<Box><b>Reader:</b> Enough! Put the bloody hatchet away, Bubbü! We know this all stems from lust. </Box>

<Box><b>Me:</b> I admit it. As I stare at the Google images of Rankin, usually peering at the lens with a mischevious smile before sweeping Edinburgh backdrops, his boyishly unkempt scissor-fringe piercing the tufty black brows, I realise I am looking at a man half of whom I will never be, I will never be that humble colossus, posing in Edinbugh pubs with Sandi Toksvig or Alan Yentob, that I will never have more than three results on the “images” page, that I will never pose with random readers in adoring selfies, that I exist in an interzone between interesting and uncommercial, and extremely bizarre and uncommercial. I am a nervy hypochondriac with no flair for living. Mr. Rankin has succeeded at life.    
</Box>

<Box><b>Reader:</b> Finally, an honest statement! </Box>

<Box><b>Me:</b> To end. Crime fiction is our means of imposing a kind of existential order to our lives. Crime fiction is a kind of moral elixir. The crime is, usually always, solved. To refuse the reader a resolution is to infuriate the reader. The crime writer, then, is in the business of reassuring people that the villainies perpetrated on the planet are always rectified. That the moral scales are always equilibrized. The crime writers themselves would be the first people to admit this is cobblers, and that evil prevails more than niceness. In that sense, these crime novels undercut their explorations of evil by offering the reader the resolution they crave, these writers are spoonfeeding the people false optimism. And there is nothing worse, carping reader, than having to open one’s maw and swallow a spoonful of hope.
