        <DropCap>T</DropCap>wo cousins wanted to wed in the Kirkwall parish chapel. There were no rules against this in the Bible, and the parish priest was hip to the groove when it came to homo-hetero-transexual ceremonies and nuptials. However, the Orcadian Society for the Preservation of the Sanctity of Marriage (shortened from a much larger name) protested that since two cousins getting married in 2010 was a reversion to barbarous practices, and as the church had turned a blind eye to gay marriage, to maintain some semblance of decency there should be no cousinly unions permitted. (Under their rules, cousinly unions were permitted thanks the historical precedent—their protest was made largely out of spite and to ruffle the overly cool parish priest’s saintly feathers). The cousins, Gerald and Geena, negotiated with the church and the OSPSM, reaching an agreement that the cousins might wed if one of the couple was on the UK mainland during the ceremony. Gerald took the Orcadian ferry to Thurso and arranged for a Skype wedding. Due to an admin delay and pressure from OSPSM agents, the marriage was not permitted for another two weeks. Finding himself in Thurso, Gerald chose to stay and soak up the culture (Brecht and Beckett performed nightly at the local theatre), and met a charming lady named Mandy, an actress who played Winnie in <i>Happy Days</i>. Gerald chose to remain in Thurso with Mandy, and abandoned the marriage. Word of Geena’s heartbreak reached the OSPSM, who kept delaying the dates of possible marriages so that gays would meet other gays off the Orcadian mainland, and not pollute Orkney with their sodomite foulness, and in that way they won their little battle.

    Due to extreme fiscal setbacks caused by the attempted pursuit of a long-term career in the writing “industry”, I ended up “chumming” a lift and a boat ride and accommodation from friends (“chumming” in this case: apologising for not having paid for a single thing on the trip afterwards) in Orkney in 2009. The booked accommodation was a self-catering cottage for four overlooking the Loch of Hundland, where Picts had carved primitive messages into sandstone (standing for, essentially, foreigners fuck off). I first observed something strange when I checked into the Grisald Guest House, run by the Grisland brothers. Most of these houses are manned by roseate locals who gambol around in dungarees, or sinister farmhands with nitroglycerine eyes, but the owners of this premises were two long-nosed hunks with chiselled features and Nordic pretensions. From their outward appearance, I had assumed their names Gustav and Olaf—however, Fred and Jeff were their rather disappointing monikers. The Orcadian accent to the untrained ear sounds Welsh as opposed to Nordic. As I unpacked my bags, I thought on the similarity of the noses, about that semi-circular crinkle to their lip muscles as they left me their mobile numbers. I went for a swim in the Loch of Hundland in a disquieted mood.

Deathbed confessions made by Orkney inbreeders: “Magnus, I hate to tell you this, but you’re your own brother.” “Mary, there’s something you should know ... I’m not your mother, I’m your daughter.” “Thorfin, I’m afraid I’ve been lying to you all these years. You aren’t actually my son, you’re my great grandfather.” “John, before the last rites are read, I should tell you, you’re actually not you ... you’re me. Sorry about that.” “Ingrid. For the last seventy years, I have been suppressing  a secret, and finally, I must tell you. You’re actually a palomino horse. Apologies.”

I scaled the top of Ben Nevis. Up there, I discovered the skeleton of Ron Wilson, my sister’s cousin’s father, who had died making the attempt due to an unforeseen blizzard. Seeing this dead man put me off my victory, so I planted my flag and began the precarious descent. He had always been a fan of colourful shoes. In his collection, he had up to ninety-nine pairs, including a set of Italian loafers once worn by Fellini. If you dared to call him a “shoe fetishist” he would reach over and punch you. I couldn’t believe my luck. I won the lottery a second time, only nine weeks after the initial win. People said it was avaricious of me to keep playing the lottery, but if you have eight million, you may as well buy a thousand tickets and increase your odds, right? I bought a small island off the coast of Mexico, where I trained sheep to perform daredevil stunts, such as setting their fur on fire and forcing them to make a Houdini-like escape from their skin before they turned into itty bitty haggises. My mother tried to stop me from running away to become a world-renowned trapeze artist. Her enormous pimpled face, with its horrible hairs poking out, stood over my bed one night and said: “If you leave, you’re no longer my daughter.” I wasn’t scared of this theatrical shit. I said: “Biologically your argument is screwy.” She slammed the door and the next morning I left to pursue my career. But anyway, now to my Orkney Story.

Things were moving slowly at <i>The Orkney Bugle</i> for journo Magthorf Harcus. The summer boom had passed, his scoops fading into paper lore: Québécois Tourist Too Fat for Mine Howe; Pterodactyl Remains Unearthed at Skara Brae; Kirkwall Jamboree a Roaring Success; George Mackay Brown’s Ghost Spotted Over Loch of Stenness; Old Man of Hoy Accused of Being a Woman; Papa Westray Flight Prices Increased. In the august and winter months, stories that weren’t wind, rain, or snow-related were scarce. He struggled through September writing these: Mouse Found on Eday; Girl Injures Ankle in The Shore; Fourth Tesco Superstore to Open in Kirkwall; Excessive Sand at Broch of Gurness Complains Man. In desperation, Magthorf manufactured stories by flexing the same imaginative muscle as island Bard George Mackay Brown. He began by travelling to the mainland, stealing a zebra from an enclosure in Aberdeen, slaying the creature, and returning to Orkney to deposit the carcass outside the house of noted racist Thornus Sabiston. Taking snaps of the slain zebra, laid outside Thornus’s shed, Magthorf ran to his editor with the snaps and a scandal was faked. Thornus denied ownership of the zebra, blaming the Vikings and coloureds for its presence, Magthorf printed that Thornus maimed a zebra as part of a hate campaign against non-Orcadians. In the article: “I hate the coloureds and wops. I butchered this zebra in protest to show how much I want them exterminated.” The liberal Orcadians were outraged. Magthorf continued to deposit more dead creatures in the shed, filling up the paper daily with updates of Thornus’s beastliness. This soap opera kept the paper’s circulation up until the stories of snow density returned, culminating perfectly in Thornus’s suicide following months of ostracism and hatred. The technique had been so successful, Magthrof would use it again the following year to spite his ex-girlfriend. Perhaps he could leave a savaged ostrich in her bed.

Swimming around the Loch of Hundland, tossing carp to passing cows, I was surprised when Fred and Jeff (not Gustav and Olaf) bobbed up from the waters to meet me. The brothers, treading water in the centre of the loch, rubbed each others’ necks, and began kissing passionately as I swam over to say hello. It was too late to retreat, as Fred had clocked me mid-snog, and waved a friendly arm. They ceased their tussle and turned to me. “Hey there, Mark! We’re having one of our erotic swims. Care to join us?” Jeff said. I looked to a carp-munching cow for help. “But you’re brothers,” I said. Fred chuckled and slapped the water. “Oh, Mark! You’ve never been to Orkney before, have you? If you had, you would have seen sets of sisters and brothers having erotic swims all over the place!” I merely nodded. Jeff chuckled this time and slapped the water again. “Come along to Heldale Water on Hoy this evening. We’re have a traditional sibling orgy, with kissing and heavy petting all night. Then we move to Hoglinns Water for full penetration.” I declined their kind offer, and wished them a happy time, causing them to chuckle again and slap the water even harder. They probably considered me parochial yokel for being uneasy with these casual late-night orgies. In the morning, it made sense to me. Everyone on Orkney was related in one way or another, so making lovers of one’s immediate family was merely part of Orcadian tradition. I went along to the next orgy at Heldale, masturbating by the side and having a wonderful time, wishing my sexy cousin was there so I might mount him.

Comments on the story by real Orcadians: 
</MainText>

<MainText pb={4}>
“Hilarious! He has really depicted our kooky, narrow-minded behaviours with searing wit and incredible insight. An honorary Orcadian!” 
</MainText>

<MainText pb={4}>
“Absolutely stunning. I haven’t read anything like this before, but then, I’ve only read the collected works of George Mackay Brown and roadmaps.” 
</MainText>
<MainText pb={4}>
“I feel like the skewer of truth has been driven through the collective Orcadian body, renewing our souls with the opiate of intelligence and imagination. Perhaps, after this story is published, a new era of Orcadian enlightenment might ensue, and some people will finally buy cordless phones.”
